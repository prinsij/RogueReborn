Tests must have text output, something like the following:

[Code] - [Description]

The FIRST CHARACTER matters
If the first character of your line is NOT ZERO (0) then the TEST IS A FAILURE
The first character may also be a HASHTAG (#), representing a comment (i.e. to section off parts for readability etc.).
