\newSection{Introduction} \label{SecIntro}

    \subsection{Project Overview}
        The Rogue Reborn project aims to develop a contemporary clone of the original \textit{Rogue} game by leveraging modern programming paradigms, development tools, and software engineering principles.  Aside from the executable, the Rogue++ team also plans to deliver a collection of commented source code, test suites, and formal documentation for both internal and public consumption.  In doing so, Rogue Reborn will serve as an open-source repository for other developers to view, comment, and contribute to the code and documentation that characterize the project in its entirety. 

    \subsection{Document Context}
        The primary purpose of the Module Guide (MG) is to describe, justify, and contextualize the module decomposition of the system.  From a developer perspective, the MG facilitates the detection of overused or purposeless modules and helps identify architectural flaws.  The document also provides a conceptual view of each module and its context in the broader system.\\

        Before the MG is written, the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document should be completed and thoroughly reviewed by all stakeholder parties.  The SRS describes requirements for the software system that the MG should relate to the implemented design.  By completing the SRS beforehand, it is more likely that the selected system design will comply with all compulsory requirements and the chosen module decomposition is appropriately structured.\\

        After the MG is complete, the complementary Module Interface Specification (MIS) can be conceived to refine the interface (external behaviour) of each module.  The MG produces a functional overview of each module, while the MIS delves into the actual implementation of the modules.  Together, the MG and MIS are sufficient to allow programmers to concurrently develop the system in a modular fashion.  
    
    \subsection{Design Principles}
        In an effort to develop code that is robust, maintainable, and more easily verifiable, the Rogue Reborn project attempts to enforce several well-regard design principles.  In particular, the principles of Information Hiding (IH), High Cohesion (HC), and Low Coupling (LC) are consistently expressed throughout the code.\\

        Information Hiding refers to the practice of concealing the implementation of modules; this is typically accomplished through encapsulation.  Using this approach encourages developers to become more mindful of their assumptions and to produce code that does not depend on the specific implementations of various functions.  Next, High Cohesion and Low Coupling describe the practice of partitioning code into modules that contain related operations and do not rely heavily on other modules.  Modules that exhibit HC lend themselves to excellent error localization, while module systems that display LC are better suited for testing purposes.  Structuring programs to emphasizes adaptability and modularity is vital to the success of any long-term software project.

    \subsection{Design Document Structure}

\newSection{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

    \subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

        Anticipated changes (AC) are the source of the information to be hidden inside modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only require changing the one module that hides the associated decision.

        \bigskip\begin{description}
            \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:] The specific hardware on which the software is running.
            \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acOs}:] The operating system on which the program will be executed.
            \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acLanguage}:] The language presented in the GUI.
            \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acAccessibility}:] The accessibility modifications used to play the game.
            \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acItems}:] The available items in the game (e.g., addition of a new potion).
            \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acMonsters}:] The number, type, and visual representation of monsters.
            \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acVisuals}:] The graphical overlay of the game (different graphical overlays could be used to alter the displayed images).
        \end{description}

    \subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

        Unlikely changes (UC) are design decisions that are deeply rooted in the system architecture and will require significant effort to modify.  As such, it is not intended that the following decision will be changed.

        \bigskip\begin{description}
            \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucMasterCtrl}:] The structure of the primary game loop in the context of the in-game entities, state parameters, and high-level flow.  Virtually every single module in the program will have to be altered to accommodate this change.
            \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucTerrain}:] The types of terrain in the game, expressed in terms of passability, transparency, and visibility. A change here will necessitate mutations in the Level, LevelGen, and PlayerChar code.
            \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucCoord}:] The definition of the coordinate system in the game.  Given the degree of code that assumes this system behaves in a particular way, modifying this structure may require plentiful module changes.
            \item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucRooms}:] The number of rooms in a dungeon level.  Altering this parameter will mandate the need for changes to the Level module, the entire Item chain, and, of course, the LevelGen module.
        \end{description}

\newSection{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

    The relationship between system design and requirements is delicate: while every module may contain one secret, this secret may involve multiple functional and non-functional requirements.   The decisions that guided the design of the system were influenced by two major factors:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Flexibility:} If any feature is deemed non-feasible, out-of-scope, or otherwise unattainable, the system should continue to function around this defect.
        \item \textbf{Logical Partitioning:} Related logic should also be structurally proximate.  Although it can be argued that this approach was motivated by the "one module, one secret" (OMOS) principle, it is actually a consequence of the duality of the high cohesion (HC) and low coupling (LC) principles.
    \end{enumerate}

    Since the mandated requirements are numerous, identifying the correspondence of each requirement is likely to dilute the ensuing discussion.  As such, only a handful of the more interestingly interactions are described below.\\

    Functional requirement (FR) 11 specifies, ``The player character shall be able to pass their turn.''  On a related note, FR 35 states, ``Each monster shall be able to calculate a plan of action during their turn.''  If neither of these requirements were mandated, a simple queue could be implemented to keep track of entity turn priority.  However, given that different actions should occupy different amounts of time, it would a poor design decision to assume that performing a task such as moving to an adjacent tile would result in the same turn delay as reading a scroll.  As a result, a more robust  implementation was constructed to factor the priorities of different actions and enable the turn-skipping feature.  Although this introduced complexity to the code, the requirement was not challenged because players can strategically skip their turns to draw nearby monsters into a more favourable location.\\

    Next, FR 37 comments, ``The player character shall be able to defeat every monster.''  It may be assumed, at this point, that a monster is defeated if its HP drops below zero.  For this FR, the entire functionality of absorbing player damage and reporting the results is handled by the Mob module.  This is deliberately excluded from the Monster module because the Monster module is designed to customize monster behavior, such as attack patterns and combative positioning.  On the other hand, the Mob module offers an interface and implementation for movement and entity statistics such as HP.\\

    Finally, FR 31 is examined: ``Scrolls, rings, and wands shall be usable.''  This FR represents one of the most difficult aspects of the game; every type of scroll, ring, and wand must provide a different activation effect.  While a purple wand may zap a goblin out of existence, a topaz ring might cause the player to suddenly levitate above the ground.  Clearly, the sheer variety and sophistication of these effects poses an interesting decomposition challenge.  As such, the logical representation of these items is divided into submodules (of the Item module) such as ``Wand'', ``Weapon'', and ``Potion''.  However, given the similarity of their activation sequences, each of these submodules implements an interface from the Item module to enable external modules to use items without needing to consider their functional diversity.

            \item[Secrets:]Input and output devices
            \item[Services:]Serves as a layer beneath the Rogue Reborn application that hides the hardware input and output devices such as keystrokes and the monitor.  The application uses this module to retrieve commands from the user and display the game state.

\newSection{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

    Within the software engineering discipline, there exists a widely-accepted belief that all Use Hierarchies must be homomorphic to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in order to avoid cyclic dependencies.  However, throughout the development of the Rogue Reborn project, the Rogue++ team discovered that a cyclic use relationship across certain modules enabled an architecture that closely resembled the natural flow of the intended interaction.  Although it would have been possible to correct the situation, the alternative designs would have an adverse effect on the high cohesion (HC) design principle and would sacrifice the maintainability and readability of the code.  As such, the Use Hierarchy drawn in \hyperref[FigUH]{Figure 1} is illustrated with a cyclic dependency stemming from the Item module.
