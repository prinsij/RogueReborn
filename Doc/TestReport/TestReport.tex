\newsection{Functional Requirements Evaluation} \label{Section_FR_Evaluation}
	Overall, an evaluation of functional requirements reveals near, if not complete coverage. The tests written for the projects turned out to be quite useful, as many caught bugs or business-errors that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. Those will be discussed below. As for the rest of the functional requirements, many were mundane, generic, or crucial enough to have already been satisfied before tests were considered. Those will not be discussed, as their complete satisfaction has already been verified countless times.\\

	The list below refers to each functional requirement by its numerical identifier, as listed in the System Requirements Specification. Please refer to the \href{run:../SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS} document if any confusion arises.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item[] \textbf{FR.16}: When performing level tests, a strange anomaly led to one test constantly failing. The test revealed that the player, in fact, did not begin at the first level. Due to an off-by-one error and slight miscommunication between developers, the current level depth the player was on was $i$ in some places and $i+1$ in others. As soon as the test revealed this, the problem was remedied globally.
		\item[] \textbf{FR.19}: Whenever the player uncovers a new dungeon level (including the very first level), an algorithm decides on a position in which to place the user initially. This algorithm while appearing flawless, actually had a very slight chance of placing the player in an unreachable location, surrounded by walls, doomed forever. With the automatic tests running thousands upon thousands of simulations, the bug was quickly revealed, and remedied.
		\item[] \textbf{FR.35}: Some monsters in Rogue Reborn follow a simple AI consisting of steps such as: Look for the player, chase the player, and if you can, hit the player. This is a very simple and easily-implemented AI to both invent and implement, but the enemies in Rogue Reborn go beyond such simple schemes. Some monsters do not seek to kill the player, but rather steal their precious items. One such pest is the Leprechaun, known as the symbol "L". The Leprechaun necessitated the implementation of a variety of methods that were previously unneeded, such as $getNearestGold()$. The testing of this function revealed some very serious performance issues in the pathfinding algorithm used throughout the project, in which infinite path traces were possible. It also revealed another bug in which the coordinates of several level features (items mostly) were accidentally set to 0, rendering them impossible to reach by pathfinding and once again causing a pathfinding failure. This was due to the assumption that all items are placed on reachable blocks. Fortunately, thanks to the various tests we implemented, these bugs were caught and fixed.
		\item[] \textbf{FR.39}: Working with C++ has its benefits, but also its drawbacks. An anomaly in the way C++ handles integers revealed a very serious bug in the code, in which player armor could reach utterly ridiculous values, rendering the player effectively invincible. By simulating every possibility of armor that can be made, this bug was caught and patched. To elaborate, the reason the bug even existed was because an unsigned integer was allowed to be reduced to a negative value, which of course means that it was not reduced to a negative number and instead went to the highest value an integer can be.
	\end{itemize}


\newsection{Non-Functional Requirements Evaluation} \label{Section_NFR_Evaluation}
	The following subsections evaluate the significant non-functional qualities of Rogue Reborn.  To simplify notation, \nfrt{$i$} is used to denote ``Non-Functional Requirements Test \# $i$'' from the \href{run:../TestPlan/TestPlan.pdf}{Test Plan} document.  Unfortunately, the usability and playtesting surveys referenced in NFRT 1, NFRT 2, NFRT 4, NFRT 7, NFRT 9, NFRT 10, NFRT 12, and NFRT 14 were not performed as a direct consequence of the time constraints imposed on the project (the \href{run:../../ProjectSchedule/rogue.gan}{Gantt Chart} schedules this survey to be released in early January 2017).  Another hindering factor is the sophisticated software environment required for compilation: publicly distributing a single executable file is not feasible since Rogue Reborn makes use of a library that exclusively compiles for Linux at the present moment.  Despite these inconveniences, an effort has been made to mention several weaker versions of these tests under their corresponding sections.

	\subsection{Usability and Aesthetics}
		Overall, the visual appearance of the application was well-received and was universally praised as an improvement over the original \textit{Rogue}.  This conclusion was derived from the interactions between the Rogue++ team and the \textit{SFWRENG 3XA3} instructor staff, as well as informal conversations with other colleagues.  Unfortunately, the usability survey described in NFRT 1 will be carried out in the future, so the impressions of the general public are not yet known.\\

		Since the usability of the original \textit{Rogue} was relatively poor due to its arbitrary key bindings, the Rogue++ team took deliberate actions to improve this area.  Specifically, the application featured arrow key bindings for the player character movements in order to accommodate a more standard and intuitive keyboard layout.  Additionally, Rogue Reborn featured a convenient help menu inside the game that listed all actionable keys and their corresponding interpretations.  However, due to the sheer quantity of key bindings, Rogue Reborn was \textit{not} successful in alleviating this issue completely.  With respect to the \href{run:../TestPlan/TestPlan.pdf}{Test Plan}, a report detailing NFRT 3 is given below.

		\nfrtc {3}
			{All strings in the Rogue Reborn source code were programmatically extracted and stored in a text file for later inspection with Microsoft Word.  The Python script used to populate the text file is located at \href{run:../../src/misc/strextract.py}{src/misc/strextract.py}.}
			{The aforementioned script discovered approximately 1400 strings.  After manually verifying the grammatical correctness and spelling of each string, it was determined that the GUI output is free of linguistic errors.}

	\subsection{Performance}
		In general, the technical performance of the Rogue Reborn client was exceptional as a consequence of the developers' decision to use C++ as opposed to a less efficient language such as Python or Java.  According to \textit{libtcod}, the application managed to average over 120 FPS (Frames Per Second) and delivered a smooth experience even while on a VM (Virtual Machine).  During the final stages of development, the Rogue++ team decided to profile the application using the GDB (GNU Debugger) with respect to peak memory usage and pleasantly discovered that the maximum amount of RAM consumed by Rogue Reborn was 1 MB.  With respect to the \href{run:../TestPlan/TestPlan.pdf}{Test Plan}, a report detailing NFRT 5 and NFRT 6 is portrayed below.

		\nfrtc {5}
			{The Rogue Reborn application was compiled with a special debug parameter that enabled particular sections of the MasterController module to measure the average maximum execution time between successive frames.}
			{The average execution time between successive user actions appeared to stabilize around 20 ms.  Clearly, this is appreciably lower than the maximum allowable delay of \tplink{MINIMUM\_RESPONSE\_SPEED} (currently $\sim$ 30 ms).}

		\nfrtc {6}
			{The following regular expression was applied across the source code to extract all integer-typed declarations: \newline
				{\centering \lstinline$(unsigned|int|long)\\s+[A-Za-z]+\\s*(,|;|=.*)\\s*$ \newline}
			 The Python script that performed the declaration extraction is located at \href{run:../../src/misc/intdeclare.py}{src/misc/intdeclare.py}.}
			{The aforementioned script identified approximately 170 candidate declarations.  Among these, there were no obvious candidates for integer overflow.}

	\subsection{Robustness, Maintainability, and Compatibility}
		As discussed during the formal presentation, the Rogue Reborn project excelled in the domains of robustness and maintainability.  One justification for this claim is that the developers implemented a CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline to immediately flag deficient commits.  In addition, compiling the Rogue Reborn source code did not generate any warnings and the system documentation is thorough, expansive, and relevant.  That being said, Rogue Reborn has yet to be released in the playtester community.  As such, it is likely that several undiscovered bugs still reside within the code base.\\

		Regarding compatibility, the project was significantly less successful: only Linux distributions are supported and SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) must be installed on the developer's machine to compile the application ~\citep{SDLHome}.  As well, the compilation and execution of Rogue Reborn was only tested on Intel x64 processors (the application is not tested on other brands or architectures). With respect to the \href{run:../TestPlan/TestPlan.pdf}{Test Plan}, a report detailing NFRT 8, NFRT 11, and NFRT 13 is conveyed below.

		\nfrtc {8}
			{The high score file was manually edited by a developer to include more than \tplink{HIGH\_SCORE\_CAPACITY} records.}
			{Only the top \tplink{HIGH\_SCORE\_CAPACITY} records with the highest score were displayed on the \hyperref[Section_M_Trace]{RipScreen} module; the rest of the records were internally acknowledged but otherwise ignored.}

		\nfrtc {11}
			{All documented ``Bug'' issues on the Rogue Reborn GitLab page were examined to ensure they were closed within 30 days of their creation.}
			{A total of 10 issues were discovered under the ``Bug'' label; all of these entries were closed within two weeks of their posting.}

		\nfrtc {13}
			{The high score file was manually edited by a developer such that several records violated the expected record format.}
			{All valid records were processed displayed on the \hyperref[Section_M_Trace]{RipScreen} module; the nonsensical records were internally acknowledged but otherwise ignored.}

	\subsection{Legality and Safety}
		Every public software project should include a license to govern the software's terms of use, development, and distribution.  Rogue Reborn was no exception and thus contained the \href{run:../../LICENSE.txt}{licensing agreement} from the original \textit{Rogue}.\\

		Regarding health and safety, the Rogue++ team was primarily concerned with the possibility of inducing a seizure by displaying two successive frames with excessively different contrasts.  With respect to the \href{run:../TestPlan/TestPlan.pdf}{Test Plan}, a report detailing NFRT 15 is pictured below.

	\nfrtc {15}
			{Two consecutive frames with the largest estimated contrast difference were captured and later processed with a Python script to compute their respective monochrome luminosities.  All resources pertaining to this test are located in the \href{run:../../src/misc/luminosity}{src/misc/luminosity} directory.}
			{The output of \href{run:../../src/misc/luminosity/lumtester.py}{lumtester.py} indicated that the frame illustrated in \href{run:../../src/misc/luminosity/minlum.png}{minlum.png} was characterized by an average luminosity of 0.03105, while the \href{run:../../src/misc/luminosity/maxlum.png}{maxlum.png} frame possessed an average luminosity of 0.59774.  Since the difference between these two values is 0.56669 and is therefore less than \tplink{LUMINOSITY\_DELTA}, the application is relatively safe for epileptic users (although a cautionary notice should be included in the final distribution package).}

\newsection{Comparison to Existing Implementation} \label{Section_Comparison}

	According to all collected resources of the original implementation, there were no tests done to verify the accuracy of the original product. This is somewhat understandable, all things considered. After all, the original product was released in 1980, almost 40 years ago. Since then, standards of software development were transformed from infanthood to the rigorous forms they take today.\\

	As such, the tests we have written have nothing to be compared to. If there were tests to compare to, we would take a look at the following:\\

	\begin{itemize}
		\item How does the coverage of the existing test cases compare to the coverage we implemented?
		\item For cases where the modules/classes are similar in both versions, how do the tests compare? Are there any significant benefits or drawbacks to one or the other?
		\item Does any one of the implementations completely neglect an aspect of another? Is the remade implementation missing something critical that the original did test for?
		\item How are random tests approached by the existing implementation? Are random numbers ever used in the testing phase?
	\end{itemize}

\newsection{Unit Testing} \label{Section_UT}
	As a means of verifying the implementation of various functions and components, the Rogue++ developers devised a suite of unit tests.  Unit testing was employed as a consequence of its superior ability to localize errors and encourage contributors to write code that is highly modular and relatively free of side effects.  Broadly speaking, the Rogue Reborn unit tests were designed to gain confidence in the code with respect to the satisfaction of the functional requirements.\\

	To mitigate the significant overhead of integrating a professional unit testing framework, the Rogue Reborn team decided to code their own custom test runner.  The implemented solution required for all tests to extend an abstract class \href{run:../../src/test.testable.h}{\lstinline$Testable$} with the interface described in \hyperref[Figure_Testable]{Figure 1}.  This restriction enabled the test driver class \href{run:../../src/test.main.cpp}{\lstinline$test.main.cpp$} to invoke all of the concrete unit test classes in a uniform manner.  In addition, to ensure that the unit tests remained relevant and visible throughout development, the CI pipeline included a stage to build, run, and evaluate the output of the testing executable.

	\begin{figure}[H] \label{Figure_Testable}
		\caption{\bf Testable Class Interface}
		\centering
		\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
 class Testable {
    public:
       virtual Testable();
       virtual ~Testable();

       // Test entry point
       virtual void test() = 0;
            
       void assert(bool condition, std::string comment);
       void comment(std::string comment);
 };
		\end{lstlisting}
	\end{figure} 

	The coverage of the tests encompassed all item abilities, various player actions and monster mechanics, virtually all level generation and processing algorithms, and even several UI functions.  Each assertion was also complemented with a comment to explain the purpose of the test.  For the convenience of the reader, a descriptive summary of every implemented test is included in the \hyperref[Section_Automated]{Automated Testing} section of this report.\\

	On the whole, these tests served well to guarantee a minimal level of functionality for each documented feature across various builds.  Naturally, the suite did not consider the non-functional requirements of the project since these qualities are much more practical to test manually.

\newsection{Automated Testing} \label{Section_Automated}

	\subsection{Automated Testing Strategy}
	For this project we elected not to use a 3rd party testing library. We made this decision to ease configuration/installation problems and reduce our dependencies, as we judged it would not be necessary. Instead a series of files (labeled test.foobar.cpp) in the repository hold tests, which are run by our custom test runner. These automated tests are run on command by executing the produced executable, or by the continuous integration script run whenever changes are pushed to the central repository. The results of these tests are automatically reported, resulting in a failed or successful build.

	\subsection{Specific System Tests}
	The following is a list of all system tests in the project.

\newsection{Code Coverage Metrics} \label{Section_Metrics}
	By looking at the test-requirements matrix, and also cross-referencing the test-module trace above with the module-requirements trace given in the Module Guide, it is possible to determine exactly which functional and non-functional requirements were satisfied with the test cases we created.\\

	As can be expected, near \textbf{complete coverage} of both functional and non-functional requirements is achieved. Except for a few non-functional requirements, the modules and direct requirements reflected in the test cases offer a complete coverage of the requirements. Some (in particular, non-functional) requirements are nigh impossible to test using code. An example includes NFR.2: "The Rogue Reborn game shall be fun and entertaining." Whatever software exists that can determine such a thing would never pass the Turing test, and thus can be deemed an impossibility as of current technology. But while it is impossible to test with code, such a thing is easily testable with human playtesters.\\

	Along with NFR.2, several non-functional requirements were not feasible to assert with software, but all were correctly proven by other means, most of which involved manual human labor.\\

	To expand on the previous statements, we encountered some requirements where the achievable target was difficult to materialize, but still algorithmic and computational in nature. A prime example of this is the luminosity constraint, which ruled that no two consecutive frames may have a change in brightness greater than some defined delta. In order to properly measure this, we had to go outside of the program, and write a separate script to do the hard work. We used python to calculate the pixel-accurate luminosity of some key screenshots, and using the calculation proposed by the non-functional requirement, arrived at correct results. The results were deemed close enough to the predefined delta, which itself was based more or less on our intuition.
