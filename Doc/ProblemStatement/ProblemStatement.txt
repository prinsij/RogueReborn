The software will be developed for aLinux desktop environment. The library in 
use (libtcod) has support for Windows environments, so a hypothetical windows
port would be relatively easy. Stakeholders include players of the original
Rogue game as well as players and developers of successor games, who may be
interested in playing/developing from the original.
