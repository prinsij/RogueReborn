From the humble beginnings of Pong and Pacman, the video game industry has evolved to 
define modern entertainment by constantly pushing the limits of hardware and software.
The technology behind contemporary video games encompasses a large variety of academic
subjects and can be as sophisticated and rigorous as any other traditional software project.
Although it is easy to forget that modern developers stand on the shoulders of giants,
it is important to remember that even classic video games were considered immense feats
of technical accomplishment in their time.  The primary goal of the "Rogue Reborn" project
is to re-create what is arguably one of the most iconic video games of all time "Rogue".
This will serve to demonstrate how the proper utilitzation of today's tools and technologies
can enhance the development process of a legacy application.

The software will be developed for a Linux desktop environment. The library in 
use (libtcod) has support for Windows environments, so a hypothetical windows
port would be relatively easy. Stakeholders include players of the original
Rogue game as well as players and developers of successor games, who may be
interested in playing/developing from the original.
